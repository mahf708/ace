# Re-running a run id continues it. There is no separate resume command: the
# trainer picks up <output>/training_checkpoints/ckpt.tar whenever it is there,
# so the same line that started a run also restarts it after a requeue, a
# crash, or a fix. --start-from-scratch is the opposite, and it moves the old
# output aside rather than deleting it.
#
# With a run id, the config is taken from ../runs/<runid>.yaml, the matching
# ../runs/<runid>.env is sourced so the run is named in wandb and sized
# correctly (FME_NODES), and the output lands in $CAMPAIGN_ROOT/<runid> rather
# than a job-id directory. The job id is printed on stdout.
#
# The aug26 campaign has no finetune chain -- every run trains from scratch --
# so --after is not needed for it. It is kept for ad-hoc use (e.g. queueing a
# continuation behind a run that is still training).
#
# Staging matters: the job reads the config at *start* time, so editing the
# tree between submit and start would otherwise change what runs. The staged
# copy under $PSCRATCH/fme-config/<uuid> is frozen and is also copied next to
# the run output as job_config/.
#
# Resume a preempted or requeued run:
#     RESUME_JOB_ID=<job id> ./run-train.sh atm
#
# Email is on by default to $USER@nersc.gov on BEGIN, END, FAIL, REQUEUE and
# TIME_LIMIT_90. Override with FME_MAIL_USER / FME_MAIL_TYPE, or FME_MAIL_TYPE=NONE.
# (Those four plus TIME_LIMIT_50/80 are the only thresholds Slurm defines; there
# is no TIME_LIMIT_95.)
#
# QOS and walltime come from the #SBATCH block and can be overridden for a
# one-off -- a short test run, say -- without editing anything:
#
#     FME_QOS=debug FME_TIME=00:30:00 ./run-train.sh atm
#
# Prefer these to Slurm's own SBATCH_QOS / SBATCH_TIMELIMIT: those are input
# environment variables, so `VAR=x` on a line of its own sets a shell variable
# that is never exported and never reaches sbatch, silently. These become
# command-line flags, which beat the #SBATCH directives outright.
# Already-queued jobs can be retrofitted without resubmitting:
#     scontrol update JobId=<id> MailUser=$USER@nersc.gov \
#         MailType=BEGIN,END,FAIL,REQUEUE,TIME_LIMIT_90
