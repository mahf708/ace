# Run several campaign runs inside ONE Slurm job, instead of one job per run.
# Modeled on e3sm_hist_v20260812/sbatch-scripts/bundle.sh (2026-09-15).
#
#     ./bundle.sh <bundle-file>                 # stage + validate + print, submit nothing
#     ./bundle.sh <bundle-file> --go            # stage, validate and submit
#
# The bundle file has one run per line, `#` comments allowed:
#
#     <runid>  <campaign root>
#     BL01.sep26v2.atm.D0_G0_I0_M2_N0_Q0_R4_Y0_Z1.S01  /pscratch/sd/m/mahf708/sep26v2
#
# The realm comes from the run id (this campaign is atm-only today, but the
# realm is still read from the id rather than hardcoded) and the node count
# from runs/<runid>.env (FME_NODES), exactly as for a single submission. Every
# run is staged through `run-train.sh --no-submit`, so config validation, the
# dirty-worktree refusal, wandb identity, FME_DATA_ROOT rewriting and the
# resume-from-ckpt.tar behaviour are the single-run path's, unchanged. The
# job's node count is the sum; sbatch-bundle.sh carves the allocation into
# disjoint node sets and starts one srun step per run.
#
# Guard against double-submission: a run id already queued or running on its
# own is refused rather than folded into the bundle, because two jobs writing
# one ckpt.tar interleave their checkpoint writes and silently corrupt the
# run. This is also what keeps this script from ever touching runs that are
# already in flight -- take them out of the bundle file, or let them finish.
#
# Environment knobs (same names as run-train.sh where they overlap):
#   FME_CONSTRAINT  -C value. Default gpu&hbm40g, matching sbatch-train-atm.sh
#                   (the atm stage-2 config fits comfortably in 40 GB).
#   FME_TIME        walltime (default 48:00:00, the regular-QOS maximum)
#   FME_TIME_MIN    --time-min for backfill (default unset)
#   FME_QOS         QOS (default regular)
#   FME_MAIL_TYPE   default FAIL,REQUEUE,TIME_LIMIT_90; NONE disables
#   BUNDLE_NAME     job name (default the bundle file's basename)
#   BUNDLE_MAX_RESTARTS  walltime requeues before the job stops requeueing
#                   itself (default 10)
#
# Why a bundle at all: nodes of a run that finishes early sit idle until the
# last run ends, and one job means one place in the queue. Worth it once the
# campaign has several runs of similar size queued at once; a lone run is
# still better off going through run-train.sh directly.
