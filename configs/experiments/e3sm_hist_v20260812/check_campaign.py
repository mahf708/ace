"""Assert that every generated run config says what its run id says it says.

`fme.ace.validate_config` proves a config *parses*. It cannot prove that
`E05.aug26.atm.A3_B16_C1_O5_W0_X0.S01` actually has CO2 and both aerosol sets,
batch 16, equal loss weights and no AMP. That is what this checks: the factor
word against the file, for all 35 runs, in about a second on a login node.

Pass the same `--local-batch` the generator was given. The constant is
duplicated here on purpose -- a check that imports the thing it is checking
cannot catch a mistake in the shared constant -- which means it has to be told
when the generator was run with a non-default value, or it computes the wrong
rank count and reports a divisibility failure that does not exist.

Run it after `generate-campaign.sh` and after any hand edit. A silent
disagreement between a run id and its config is the worst failure mode this
campaign has -- every plot and every conclusion is labelled by the run id.
