# E3SMv3 historical — ACE2S atmosphere, Samudra ocean, SamudrACE coupled

Training configurations for the E3SMv3 historical run
`v3.LR.historical_0101.aigo` (1940–2065, 180×360). Three configs: an
atmosphere, an ocean, and a coupled finetune that composes the two.

All three read the **raw run directory directly** — there is no preprocessing
step. The coupled stepper averages the atmosphere's generated fluxes over the
ocean's step window at runtime, and resolves SST→TS online.

| config | trains | timestep | reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `config-train-atm.yaml` | ACE2S atmosphere | 6-hourly | `eam.h0.*.nc` |
| `config-train-ocn.yaml` | Samudra ocean | 5-day (or 1-day, see below) | `mpaso`/`mpassi` `*5D*.remapped.nc` + LANDFRAC |
| `config-train-cpl.yaml` | coupled finetune | both | both |

**Production order:** train the atmosphere and the ocean separately, then
regenerate the coupled config with both checkpoints injected and finetune.

> **The two component configs are hackathon baselines, not templates.**
> `config-train-atm.yaml` *is* run `E01` and `config-train-ocn.yaml` *is* run
> `E11` of the 2026-08-31 campaign
> ([page](https://e3sm.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/p3ai/pages/6550683662)).
> Every other run is generated from them by `make_ablation_config.py`. Editing
> either file changes the campaign's control, so read
> [EXPERIMENTS.md](EXPERIMENTS.md) first.

## Quickstart

```bash
# 0. one-time, per clone
uv sync --frozen                      # ~1 min; the venv is not shared between users
./stage-shared-data.sh --check        # confirms the input data is where the configs expect

# 1. sanity-check a config without burning an allocation
uv run python -m fme.ace.validate_config --config_type train config-train-ocn.yaml

# 2. a ~20 minute end-to-end smoke test on 4 GPUs
uv run python make_smoke_config.py config-train-ocn.yaml $PSCRATCH/smoke-ocn.yaml \
    --experiment-dir $PSCRATCH/smoke-out
uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 -m fme.ace.train $PSCRATCH/smoke-ocn.yaml

# 3. a production run (submits to the batch queue, resumes automatically)
./sbatch-scripts/run-train.sh ocn

# 4. the whole 2026-08-31 campaign: 35 runs generated from the two baselines
./sbatch-scripts/generate-campaign.sh --list      # run list + node budget
./sbatch-scripts/generate-campaign.sh             # writes runs/ (48 configs)
./sbatch-scripts/submit-campaign.sh --dry-run     # what would be queued
RESERVATION=_CAP_aigs_hist ./sbatch-scripts/submit-campaign.sh

# 5. the stochastic-vs-deterministic block (E18-E28) -- its own window
./sbatch-scripts/submit-campaign.sh --dry-run --max-priority 8
```

`generate-campaign.sh` writes 48 configs: aug26's 35 (P1-P4) and the
stochastic block's 13 (P5-P8). `submit-campaign.sh` queues P1-P4 only unless
told otherwise, so the second block cannot be released by accident.

### Job names and logs

A submission with a run id is named after the run, so `squeue` distinguishes
the 25 atmosphere jobs instead of showing `fme-hist-atm` 25 times. `--output`
is `joblogs/%x-%j.out` and `%x` is the job name, so the log follows:

    joblogs/E01.aug26.atm.A0_B16_C0_L0_O5_W0_X0.S01-57723725.out

`--chdir` pins the working directory to this one, so the log lands in the same
place regardless of where you invoked the script from. Ad-hoc runs (no run id)
keep the generic `fme-hist-<realm>` name.

Every job log opens with a banner — grep for `=== run`:

    runid        E01.aug26.atm.A0_B16_C0_L0_O5_W0_X0.S01
    job          E01.aug26.atm...S01 / 57723725
    restarts     0
    nodes        4 (nid[001234-001237])
    ranks        16
    config       /pscratch/.../fme-config/<uuid>/E01...yaml
    output       /pscratch/.../aug26/E01...S01
    commit       867e1da1e...
    wandb        E01...S01 in E01.atm

`restarts` is `SLURM_RESTART_COUNT`: on a requeued segment it is non-zero, which
is how you tell a fresh start from the fourth restart of the same run.

Jobs already queued can be renamed without resubmitting — Slurm re-resolves the
`%x` in the output path, so the log filename updates too:

```bash
scontrol update JobId=<id> JobName=<runid>
```

### Email notifications

`run-train.sh` sets them on every submission, so `submit-campaign.sh` inherits:

| | |
|---|---|
| to | `$USER@nersc.gov` — override with `FME_MAIL_USER` |
| on | `BEGIN,END,FAIL,REQUEUE,TIME_LIMIT_90` — override with `FME_MAIL_TYPE` |
| off | `FME_MAIL_TYPE=NONE` |

`REQUEUE` is the one worth having: a 12 h segment that hits its walltime
requeues itself and nothing on the terminal says so, and a run that requeues
all night is paying dataset setup each time (22.5 min atm, 10.5 min ocn).
`TIME_LIMIT_90` arrives ~72 min before that handoff, which is the window to
cancel rather than let it restart.

The whole 35-run campaign is order 250 messages. To hear only about trouble:

```bash
FME_MAIL_TYPE=FAIL,TIME_LIMIT_90 ./sbatch-scripts/submit-campaign.sh
```

Jobs already in the queue can be retrofitted without resubmitting:

```bash
scontrol update JobId=<id> MailUser=$USER@nersc.gov \
    MailType=BEGIN,END,FAIL,REQUEUE,TIME_LIMIT_90
```

**During the hackathon window you must export `RESERVATION=_CAP_aigs_hist`.**
Nothing sets it for you, and without it every job sits in the regular queue
while the 96 reserved nodes idle. Drop it for anything that will continue past
the window's end (Sat 2026-09-05 15:00) — a segment that cannot finish inside
the reservation will not start in it.

The coupled config uses a **different entry point** — `fme.coupled.train` and
`fme.coupled.validate_config`, not `fme.ace.*`. `run-train.sh` handles this.

### Why the scripts exist rather than being config

* **`make_cpl_config.py`** — 412 of the coupled config's 837 lines (49%) are a
  verbatim mirror of the atm and ocn stepper blocks. YAML anchors do not cross
  files, so this script is the only thing keeping ~410 lines of channel
  definitions in sync. **Regenerate after editing either component config.**
  `--check` exits non-zero with a diff if the committed file has drifted, and
  is the thing to run in CI.
* **`make_smoke_config.py`** — `--override` is a dotlist and cannot index into
  a YAML list, so it cannot reach the `inference` blocks or `concat`/`merge`
  members. The script also keeps inference initial conditions on the ocean's
  5-day axis and keeps the coupled realms' first timestamps equal; both are
  enforced at runtime and fail the run otherwise.
* **`make_landfrac_ocn.py`** — produces a data file no config can synthesise.
* **`make_ablation_config.py`** — the campaign's 35 runs differ in channel
  lists, loss weights, batch size and rank count, and three of those cannot be
  expressed as `--override` dotlists at all (they index into YAML lists). The
  script is also where the divisibility rules and the `5yr_test` final-epoch
  rule are enforced, on a login node, before an allocation is burned.

## Weights & Biases

All 35 runs go to **one** project so both realms sit in the same workspace:

| | |
|---|---|
| entity | `e3sm-aig` |
| project | `SamudrACE-E3SMv3` |

`entity` is the **team**, not the account. `wandb login` prints
`Currently logged in as: <username> (<entity>)`, so `e3sm-ai` is the account and
`e3sm-aig` is what goes in `logging.entity`. `check_campaign.py` asserts both on
every generated config.

Run identity is **not** in the yaml — `WANDB_NAME`, `WANDB_RUN_GROUP`,
`WANDB_JOB_TYPE`, `WANDB_TAGS` and `WANDB_NOTES` are read straight from the
environment by the wandb library. `make_ablation_config.py` writes them into
`runs/<runid>.env` and `run-train.sh` exports them, so a campaign run is named
and tagged automatically and an ad-hoc `run-train.sh atm` lands unnamed.

    WANDB_NAME=E17.aug26.ocn.A0_B16_C0_O1_W0_X0.S01
    WANDB_RUN_GROUP=aug26.ocn.E17          # seeds collapse into one group
    WANDB_JOB_TYPE=A0_B16_C0_O1_W0_X0      # the factor word
    WANDB_TAGS=aug26,E17,ocn,A0,B16,C0,O1,W0,X0,S01,P2

Every factor is its own tag, so "every C1 run" or "every W2 run" is a filter.

### Logging in

**Each person uses their own key — do not pass one key around.** A W&B API key
is a personal credential: whoever holds it can read, edit and delete anything
that account can, and every run made with it is attributed to that account, so
"who ran this" stops being answerable.

The supported way to share a project is to share the **team**:

1. A team admin adds each person to the `e3sm-aig` team in the W&B UI
   (Team settings → Members → Invite).
2. Each person runs `wandb login` once on Perlmutter and pastes **their own** key
   from <https://wandb.ai/authorize>. That writes `~/.netrc` mode 600.
3. Runs land in `e3sm-aig/SamudrACE-E3SMv3` regardless of who launched them,
   because the entity and project come from the config.

For unattended jobs that should not carry a person's identity, W&B supports
**team service accounts** (Team settings → Service accounts). That key is
designed to be shared inside a team and its runs are attributed to the service
account. That is the right mechanism if a shared key is genuinely wanted.

Either way the key belongs in `~/.netrc` or in `WANDB_API_KEY` in the
environment — **never** in a config, in the repo, or on the wiki page. If a key
does end up somewhere shared, rotate it at <https://wandb.ai/authorize>.

## Prerequisites

### Data

The raw model output is on the Community File System and is readable by the
`e3sm` group:

    /global/cfs/cdirs/e3smdata/simulations/v3.LR.historical_0101.aigo/run/

1501 files per stream, four streams, ~3.7 TB.

Two smaller **inputs** are derived products: the normalization statistics and
`LANDFRAC` resampled onto the ocean's 5-day axis (~115 MB together). These were
originally produced into personal scratch. Before sharing or running this
branch, relocate them:

    ./stage-shared-data.sh

This copies both trees to
`/global/cfs/cdirs/e3smdata/emulator/SamudrACE-E3SMv3/historical/`, sets
group-read (not world-read) permissions, and rewrites the paths in the two
component configs, then regenerates the coupled one. It is idempotent and never
clobbers an existing copy; `--check` reports without changing anything.

Do this rather than leaving the configs pointing at `$PSCRATCH`: scratch is
purged on an inactivity policy and is not backed up, so a colleague cloning
this branch months from now would hit `FileNotFoundError`. NERSC's guidance is
to share through a project directory with group permissions and to
[avoid world-readable data](https://docs.nersc.gov/filesystems/sharing/).

The three `experiment_dir` values are **outputs** and intentionally stay on
personal scratch — the batch scripts override them per job.

### Environment

The repo uses `uv`, not conda. From the repo root:

    uv sync --frozen

Roughly one minute. Verified on Perlmutter's current stack (`cpe/26.03`,
`cudatoolkit/13.2`) as of 2026-08-24: torch 2.10.0+cu128, NCCL 2.27.5,
8-rank multi-node all-reduce correct. The venv is per-clone; each user builds
their own.

On OLCF Frontier the environment is ROCm-based and set up differently — see
`NOTES-frontier-env.md` and `frontier-env.sh`. Nothing here has been *trained*
on Frontier, and the sizing and timing below are Perlmutter measurements.

**`pre-commit` cannot run on Perlmutter** — it takes an `flock` under `$HOME`
and that filesystem returns `OSError: [Errno 524]`. Run the pinned hooks
directly:

    export UV_TOOL_DIR=/tmp/$USER/uvtools UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/$USER/uvcache
    uvx ruff@0.8.1 check <files>
    uvx ruff@0.8.1 format --check <files>
    uvx --with types-PyYaml==5.4.3 mypy@1.15.0 \
        --ignore-missing-imports --check-untyped-defs <files>

Pin the versions — a newer ruff reformats untouched lines and adds diff noise.

## Sizing: how many GPUs

Two divisibility rules must both hold, and they decide the rank count for you:

1. **`batch_size` must be divisible by the number of ranks.** Reported clearly.
   `batch_size` is *global* — `dist.local_batch_size` divides it across ranks
   (`fme/ace/data_loading/getters.py:120`), so widening a run is changing the
   global batch unless you hold `batch_size` fixed.
2. **Each inference block's initial-condition count must be divisible by the
   rank count.** Reported as `UnionMatchError: can not match type "list"`,
   which says nothing useful — re-validate at the same world size to see the
   real message.

| config | train `batch_size` | val `batch_size` | inference ICs | **valid rank counts** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| atm | 16 | 16 | 16, 16 | 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 |
| ocn | 16 | 16 | 16, 16 | 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 |
| cpl | 8 | 8 | 8 | 1, 2, 4, 8 |

Measured peak memory per GPU on `A100-SXM4-80GB`, **at the current
`embed_dim: 384` baseline with `checkpointing: 3`** (2026-08-29, 16 ranks):

| config | local batch | peak/GPU | |
|---|---|---|---|
| atm | 1 | **19.0 GB** | runs, with three-quarters of the card free |
| ocn | 4 | 15.5 GB | runs |
| cpl | 1 | 37.8 GB steady, 77.1 GB peak | runs; measured at `embed_dim: 512` |

The atmosphere model is 456,223,488 trainable parameters at `embed_dim: 384`.

**Superseded, kept for the record.** The earlier figures — atm 61.8 GB at local
batch 1 and an OOM at local batch 2 — were measured at `embed_dim: 512` with
`checkpointing: 0`. The current baseline is narrower *and* checkpointed, which is
why it is 3× smaller. Do not quote the 61.8 GB number against today's config.

**Local batch 2 measures 28.7 GB at 384** — it fits with room to spare and is
marginally better per sample. It halves the node count of every run but doubles
the epoch, so the campaign stays at local batch 1; see `EXPERIMENTS.md`
"Measurements" for the trade.

To go wider at fixed local batch, raise `batch_size` to the rank count and add
initial conditions so their count stays divisible too — but note that this
changes the **global** batch, which for the campaign is a scientific variable
(the `B` factor), not a free knob. Per-GPU memory does not change with rank
count at fixed local batch, so scaling out this way costs the same GPU-hours and
buys wall time at the price of a different optimizer trajectory.

`make_ablation_config.py` does all of this for the campaign runs, and
`run-train.sh` reads the resulting node count out of the run's `.env`.

---

## Launching

### Batch (production)

    ./sbatch-scripts/run-train.sh atm|ocn|cpl

The driver stages the config to `$PSCRATCH/fme-config/<uuid>` so edits between
submit and start cannot change what runs, validates it (catching the
divisibility errors before the allocation starts), then submits. The job
handles preemption and walltime: `SIGTERM` stops cleanly, `USR1` requeues, and
training resumes from the last checkpoint. A copy of exactly what ran is left
in `<experiment_dir>/job_config/`.

Resume a requeued or preempted run explicitly:

    RESUME_JOB_ID=<job id> ./sbatch-scripts/run-train.sh atm

### Interactive

    # single node, up to 4 GPUs
    uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 -m fme.ace.train config-train-ocn.yaml

    # multiple nodes, from inside an salloc
    MASTER=$(scontrol show hostnames $SLURM_NODELIST | head -1)
    srun --nodes=2 --ntasks-per-node=1 --gpus-per-node=4 \
      bash -c "uv run torchrun --nnodes=2 --nproc_per_node=4 \
                 --node_rank=\$SLURM_NODEID --master_addr=$MASTER --master_port=29517 \
                 -m fme.ace.train config-train-atm.yaml"

Pass an explicit `--master_port`: `torchrun` defaults to 29500 and two runs on
one node collide with `EADDRINUSE`.

**Do not use `FME_USE_SRUN=1` on Perlmutter.** That launcher hardcodes
`torch.cuda.set_device(0)` assuming `--gpus-per-task=1`; with the
`--gpus-per-node=4` binding used here every rank dies at the first collective
with `ncclUnhandledCudaError ... invalid device ordinal`. `torchrun` sets the
device from `LOCAL_RANK`, which is correct. On Frontier the srun path *is* the
right one — one rank per GCD with `--gpus-per-task=1 --gpu-bind=closest`.

### Checkpointing and resuming

`save_checkpoint: true` in all three configs. Checkpoints land in
`<experiment_dir>/training_checkpoints/`:

| file | ocean | coupled |
|---|---|---|
| `ckpt.tar` (full training state) | 1.3 GB | 14.1 GB |
| `best_ckpt.tar` | 341 MB | 3.5 GB |
| `best_inference_ckpt.tar` | 341 MB | 3.5 GB |

Resuming is automatic: relaunch against the same `experiment_dir` and it logs
`Resuming training from ...` / `Beginning epoch after N complete epochs`.
A checkpoint is written at every epoch boundary and again on graceful
shutdown (atomic tmp-file + rename, so a killed save leaves the previous one
intact), and resume skips the batches already processed in the current
epoch — a USR1 requeue mid-epoch therefore continues the epoch rather than
repeating it, verified on job 57761772, which resumed with `skip first 148
batches since these were already processed for this epoch`. The mid-epoch save
has to beat torchrun's agent, which SIGKILLs the ranks 30 s after the signal
reaches it (`PContext.close` defaults to `timeout=30`), and it does so with
room: the collective teardown took 587 ms and the 6.8 GiB restart checkpoint
10.4 s. Budget disk: the coupled `ckpt.tar` is 14 GB and is rewritten every
epoch.

## Timing and planning

Measured on A100-80GB. Dataset setup happens per rank before any training.

| | dataset setup | 1 train epoch | validation + inference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ocn, production width, 4 GPU** | **8m41s** | **3601s (60 min)**, 410 batches | ~4 min |
| **atm, production width, 8 GPU** | **20m45s** | not measured (far longer) | — |
| **cpl, production width, 4 GPU** | **50m57s** | not measured; 1643 batches/epoch | — |
| ocn, 6-yr window, 4 GPU | 1m11s | 3m51s, 13 batches | 2m40s |
| atm, 6-yr window, 8 GPU | 2m00s | 2.11 s/batch | 8m56s |
| **cpl, 6-yr window, 8 GPU, production rollouts** | **24m54s** | **28m36s**, 28 batches | ~11 min |

Extrapolated to production:

| config | ranks | batches/epoch | s/batch | **h/epoch** | `max_epochs` | **total** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ocn | 8 | 411 | **1.390** (measured alone; 2.945 contended) | **0.16** | 150 | **1.0 day** |
| ocn, 1-daily | 8 | 2053 | **1.538** | **0.88** | 30 | **1.1 days** |
| atm | 16 | 8210 | **0.925** (measured, tuned loader) | **2.11** | 30 | **2.6 days** |
| cpl (production rollouts) | 8 | 1643 | **61.3** (measured) | **~28** | 5 | **~6 days** |

**The ocean row is also measured, and also moved by the loader.** At 8 ranks the
old `num_data_workers: 2, prefetch_factor: 1` gave **24.36 s/step** against
**3.10 s/step** at 8/4 — both contended, so read the ratio rather than the
absolutes. Measured **alone** the committed config is **1.390 s/step**, a
0.16 h epoch and 150 epochs in ~24 h.

**Contention is worth 2× on the ocean.** The same config measured 1.390 s/step
alone and 2.945 s/step alongside one other 2-node job on disjoint nodes — CFS is
the binding resource, not the nodes. Setup moves too, 10.5 → 13.1 min. Expect
campaign-scale numbers to be worse than any of these; stagger launches.

**Do not add `time_buffer` to the ocean.** `time_buffer: 10` with
`time_buffer_pool_size: 2` is killed by the host OOM killer before the first
step. Each worker holds `prefetch_factor` input batches of
`local_batch × (n_timesteps + time_buffer)` samples, and the ocean's window is
~4.5× the atmosphere's (91 channels vs ~50, local batch 2 vs 1, 5 timesteps vs
2), so the in-flight host memory goes 28 → 84 GB per node. It also is not needed:
alone at `time_buffer: 0` a full 411-step epoch shows **no stalls at all**, every
interval between 1.00 and 1.50 s. Raising workers and prefetch is what mattered.

The older "410 × 8.8 s ≈ 1.0 h/epoch at 4 ranks" row was measured at 4 ranks with
the starved loader; do not quote it against today's config.

**The atmosphere row is measured, and it moved by 3.4× on 2026-08-29.** With the
loader as previously committed (`num_data_workers: 2`, `prefetch_factor: 1`,
default `time_buffer_pool_size: 1`) the effective rate was **3.155 s/batch** —
7.2 h/epoch, and `max_epochs: 30` would not have fitted the hackathon window.
The step log was bimodal: twenty steps at 17–18 s, then one interval at
163–216 s, with GPU memory flat throughout. At `8 / 4 / 2` it is **0.925 s/batch**
with 500 consecutive clean steps. Both baselines now ship those settings; see
`EXPERIMENTS.md` "Measurements" for the caveats, including that the ocean was
not measured.

**The coupled figure is now measured, not extrapolated** (2026-08-24): a 6-year
window on 8 ranks with the *production* training rollouts — `n_coupled_steps: 4`
and the atmosphere `n_steps` distribution reaching 41 — completed a full
two-epoch cycle, exit 0, at 61.3 s/batch in the steady-state epoch. `batch_size`
is 8 in both cases, so batches/epoch is unchanged by rank count and this scales
directly: **~28 h/epoch, ~6 days for 5 epochs**, plus 51 minutes of setup per
job.

That is roughly double the ">13 h/epoch" floor previously guessed, so budget
accordingly. Two caveats: the measurement ran with another job competing for the
filesystem, and a 6-year window has different caching behaviour than the full
90-year record. Re-measure on the first production job and expect the real
number to sit in the 25–35 h/epoch range.

### Planning rules

* **Do not submit any of these to a 4-hour queue.** The cheapest full epoch
  (ocean) is an hour on top of a 9-minute build.
* **Request `setup + n_epochs × h_per_epoch`, then round up.** Setup is paid
  again on every requeue — 51 minutes for the coupled config.
* **Lean on checkpoint/resume** rather than fitting a whole run in one job.
* **Scale the atmosphere by rank count, not batch size** (it needs local batch
  1). Every inference block's IC count must divide the rank count too.
* **Watch `training_samples_per_second_on_rank_0`.** A large shortfall usually
  means filesystem contention, not a model problem.

Setup cost is dominated by reading every file's time coordinate. That is
memoized per distinct file list, so a config opening the same stream for
train/validation/inference pays it once. It still scales with the number of
distinct streams, which is why the coupled config (five streams plus the
atmosphere, ~1500 files each) takes 51 minutes before the first batch. **A long
silent startup is not a hang** — check for growing log lines or `py-spy dump`.

---

## Making the coupled config fit, and making it cheaper

The coupled config peaks at 77.1 GB on an 80 GB card. Three approaches were
considered; the measurements below say which one to use.

### Gradient checkpointing — recommended, and already implemented

`SFNONetConfig.checkpointing` (0=off, 1=encoder/decoder, 2=+block MLPs,
3=every block) trades recompute for activation memory. **Measured on 8 A100s,
same nodes, same config, only the flag changed:**

| | peak/GPU | s/batch |
|---|---|---|
| atmosphere, `checkpointing: 0` | 61.8 GB | 2.11 |
| atmosphere, `checkpointing: 3` | **28.4 GB** | 1.48 |

Both rows are `embed_dim: 512`. **Re-measured at `embed_dim: 384` on
2026-08-29, 8 ranks, same nodes, only the flag changed:**

| | peak/GPU | s/batch |
|---|---|---|
| atmosphere 384, `checkpointing: 0` | 40.9 GB | 0.830 |
| atmosphere 384, `checkpointing: 3` | **19.0 GB** | 0.850 |

**A 54% memory reduction for 3–5% of step time.** The "+33% step compute" cost
quoted for the 512-wide model does not survive the move to 384 — checkpointing
is close to free here, and there is no reason to turn it off. Local batch 2 at
`checkpointing: 3` measures 28.7 GB and 1.660 s/batch (0.830 s/sample), so it
fits comfortably; see `EXPERIMENTS.md` for why the campaign stays at local
batch 1 anyway.

A 54% memory reduction, with gradients verified **bit-identical** to the
uncheckpointed path (it is exact recompute, not an approximation). Throughput
did not regress in this measurement — plausibly because the baseline runs near
capacity where the allocator thrashes — but the two runs had different
filesystem contention, so treat the speedup as unconfirmed and the memory
saving as solid.

This makes the coupled model fit with wide headroom, and it is the reason not
to spend scientific capital shrinking the model.

**The coupled fit is measured, not extrapolated** (2026-08-25): a 6-year-window
coupled run with `checkpointing: 3` and the worst case *forced* — the
atmosphere's 41-step outcome and the ocean's 4-step outcome both at
probability 1.0, so every batch drew the maximum rollout — completed a full
epoch plus validation plus the 876-step inference, exit 0, at a flat
**43.3–44.1 GB/GPU during training and 45.6 GB peak during EMA validation**
across all 8 ranks. Same window without checkpointing: 77.1 GB (96% of the
card). Forced-worst-case batches cost ~75 s each vs 61.3 s under the natural
draw distribution.

An isolated production-width benchmark (fwd+bwd+fused-AdamW step, effective
batch 2, no I/O) puts the tradeoff at **−64% peak memory (46.6 → 16.8 GB) for
+33% step compute**, with gradients bit-identical across levels (max abs diff
exactly 0.0 over all 135 parameter tensors). Levels 1 and 2 are not worth it:
level 1 saves ~0.5 GB and level 2 ~7.7 GB at the same kind of recompute churn —
use 3 or nothing.

> **This required a bug fix, included on this branch.** The four
> `torch.utils.checkpoint` call sites omitted `use_reentrant=False`. The
> reentrant implementation returns an output with no `grad_fn` when no *input*
> requires grad — which is always the case, since the network input is data —
> so `checkpointing >= 1` silently left the encoder's parameters at
> `grad=None`, training a frozen randomly-initialised encoder while raising
> nothing louder than a `UserWarning`. **Any earlier run that set
> `checkpointing >= 1` is suspect.** Regression tests are in
> `fme/core/models/conditional_sfno/test_sfnonet.py`.

To enable it, add to the atmosphere's builder config (then regenerate the
coupled config):

    stepper.step.config.builder.config.checkpointing: 3

### Where the memory actually goes

Worth knowing before reaching for other levers. The atmosphere is 800.3M
parameters (94% of them in the spectral filter, which scales as
`num_layers × embed_dim² × lmax`); the ocean is 82.8M. At local batch 1 with
`n_ensemble: 2`, roughly **67% of the atmosphere's memory is activations**.

Crucially, **activation memory does not scale with rollout length here.** The
atmosphere pretrain uses `n_forward_steps: 1`, and `optimize_last_step_only`
wraps every non-optimized step in `torch.no_grad()`, so exactly one step
carries gradients regardless of whether 1 or 41 are drawn. The knob is network
width and depth, not rollout — which is exactly why checkpointing works so well.

### Other levers, and why they rank lower

* **bf16 autocast** (`enable_automatic_mixed_precision: true`) — a *speed*
  lever, not a memory lever. Measured in isolation: it saves only ~4.3 GB
  uncheckpointed and ~0.4 GB after `checkpointing: 3`, because the spectral
  path upcasts to fp32 internally (`s2convolutions.py` calls `x.float()`
  before the SHT), so the dominant spectral activations stay fp32 under
  autocast. It is, however, **11–13% faster per step**, which claws back a
  third of checkpointing's compute cost. Two cautions: it has no loss-curve
  A/B yet, and in the *coupled* trainer autocast wraps the loss and the
  per-step `backward()` too (`fme/coupled/stepper.py`), an untested
  combination — enable it on the single-realm pretrains first if at all.
* **Shrinking `embed_dim`/`num_layers`** — real capacity cut requiring a full
  retrain to evaluate. Only if the two above fail. `filter_num_groups` cuts
  filter parameters without touching activations (the group reshape is a
  view). `spectral_ratio < 1` cuts both parameters *and* the spectral-domain
  activations roughly in proportion — but it changes the model class
  (`pre_proj`/`post_proj` projections, l=0 mode no longer exactly preserved),
  so it is a retrain-and-evaluate decision, not a free memory knob.
* **Dropping the 41-step atmosphere outcome** — removes the peak, but costs the
  only ≥10-day coupled horizon, and buys only ~3.5% walltime. Emergency use only.
* **Spatial/model parallelism** — not viable for this campaign. The backward
  pass is wrong on `main` (`_AutogradAllReduce.backward` returns `grad_output`
  unchanged); the fix lives on an unmerged branch, the aggregators and data
  writers are not shard-aware, and checkpointing under `H/W > 1` is untested.
  Forward-only equivalence is mature; training is not.
* **`n_ensemble: 1`** — halves activations, but CRPS at one member degenerates
  to MAE, so this switches ACE2S to a deterministic model. That is a
  model-class decision, not a memory optimisation.

### Reducing walltime

* **Ocean I/O first.** An epoch is 6560 samples through an 83M-parameter,
  already-checkpointed model at 8.8 s/batch — far more time than the FLOPs
  justify. It is almost certainly I/O-bound on the three-way netCDF merge.
  Raising `num_data_workers` (currently 2) and `prefetch_factor` (1) is free to
  try; preprocessing to zarr is the fallback.
* **Scale out.** Per-GPU memory is independent of rank count at fixed local
  batch, so the atmosphere at 16 ranks is ~4 days instead of 8 for the same
  GPU-hours.
* **Cut the *ocean's* `n_steps` distribution, not the atmosphere's.** The
  stepper runs `max(ocean_steps, ceil(atm_steps / 20))` outer steps per batch
  (20 six-hour atmosphere steps per 120-hour ocean step), so with the current
  draws the expectation is 2.29 and the ocean's `steps: 4` outcome (p=0.3)
  is what mostly drives it. Moving that mass to `steps: 2` is **−25%
  walltime**; to `steps: 1`, −37%. Dropping the atmosphere's 41-step outcome
  (p=0.05) buys only ~−2.5%.
* **Halving the coupled finetune record** (your 100→50 year idea) is exactly
  linear: 1643 → ~820 batches/epoch, **−50%**. It is the largest single
  walltime win and it costs no memory. The caveat: the config concatenates
  1940–1990 and 2000–2040, so halving drops one forcing regime rather than
  merely thinning samples. Prefer the ocean-rollout cut first since that is
  free; combine the two if you need more.

## Scientific configuration

### CO2 and aerosol channels

Training on historical rather than piControl is about the forced trend, so the
atmosphere carries it explicitly:

* **Inputs** (forcings): `global_mean_co2` (renamed from the scalar `co2vmr`,
  which the loader broadcasts to the grid), `aerindexall` (aerosol index),
  `colccn.3` (column CCN at S=0.3%).
* **Outputs** (diagnostics, loss weight 1.0): `lwp`, `lcc`, `cdnc`, all also in
  `force_positive_names`.

The atmosphere is **46 in / 53 out**, 38 prognostic. `colccn.3` contains a
literal dot — it is used only as a list entry and dict key, never through
dotlist overrides, which would misparse it.

`make_cpl_config.py` takes `--atm-ckpt` / `--ocn-ckpt` to inject
`stepper_training.<realm>.parameter_init.weights_path` for the finetune. Pass
each component's `best_ckpt.tar` (a stepper checkpoint, not the training-state
`ckpt.tar`). With no flags the realms train from scratch.

### Stochastic vs deterministic: E18–E28

Added 2026-09-02. Thirteen atmosphere runs on **E01's tuning set**, varying only
the training objective — loss (`EnsembleLoss` vs `MSE`), ensemble members,
training rollout and `noise_embed_dim`. They carry a second, optional factor
word in a field of their own:

    E01.aug26.atm.A0_B16_C0_L0_O5_W0_X0.S01                       <- unchanged
    E21.aug26.atm.A0_B16_C0_L0_O5_W0_X0.D1_I0_M1_RF1_Z00.S01

E01 is the control for the whole block, so it is not repeated. **The block is
P5–P8 and `submit-campaign.sh` defaults to `--max-priority 4`**, so an aug26
submission cannot release it; queueing it takes `--max-priority 8` and, given
52 nodes and ~4,100 node-hours, a window of its own.

Three things worth knowing before touching it:

* `noise_embed_dim: 0` requires `noise_type: gaussian`. With `isotropic` the
  model draws its noise field before the layers ignore it and dies in the FFT.
  The generator handles it; the checker enforces it.
* E28 warm-starts from E21 and `run-train.sh` **refuses to submit it** until
  E21's `best_ckpt.tar` exists under `$CAMPAIGN_ROOT`.
* At equal epochs the deterministic pole gets half the stochastic pole's
  compute, because it runs one ensemble member. Say "at equal epochs".

Full design, cost table and decision rules: EXPERIMENTS.md, "Stochastic vs
deterministic — E18–E28".

### Inference blocks

Each config carries a `weight: 1.0` block scored during training and a
`weight: 0.0` `5yr_test` block that is monitored but never selects the best
checkpoint. The coupled `5yr_test` initial conditions start in 2040, after the
second training window closes, so the finetune has genuine out-of-sample
monitoring; a 365-step (5-year) rollout from the last of them ends in 2052,
inside the 2065 record.

### Ocean forcing: EAM names, MPAS data

### Ocean cadence: 5-day and 1-day streams both exist

The run directory carries both, 1501 files each, 1940–2065:

| | streams | timestep | records/month |
|---|---|---|---|
| **O5** | `fmeDepthCoarsening5D`, `fmeDerivedFields5D`, `fmeSeaiceDerivedFields5D` | 5 days | 6 |
| **O1** | the same names **without** the `5D` suffix | 1 day | 30 |

Both are interval **means** (`time_bnds` span 5 days and 1 day), so switching is
a data swap rather than a resample. Measured: per step the cadences are within
~10% (1.390 vs 1.538 s), so the epoch cost is essentially the 5× sample count —
but **dataset setup goes 10.5 → 50.7 min**, because the config builds 12 datasets
and each opens all 1501 files to read time coordinates, with 5× the records each.
That is paid on every start and requeue. The daily `fmeDepthCoarsening` also carries
95 `*_inst` variables the 5-day stream does not; nothing here uses them.

Four things move together, which is why `make_ablation_config.py` handles it
rather than a `sed`: the three MPAS file patterns, the LANDFRAC aux file (which
must be on the matching axis — `make_landfrac_ocn.py --cadence 1d`), each
inference block's `n_forward_steps` (365 → 1825 for the same 5-year rollout),
and `max_epochs` (an epoch holds 5× the samples). `check_campaign.py` rejects a
config whose four merge members disagree on cadence — that either fails at load
on time alignment or silently trains on the intersection.

**Coupling.** `fme/coupled/requirements.py` *derives* the ratio,
`n_steps_fast = ocean_timestep / atmosphere_timestep`, and requires the
atmosphere timestep to divide the ocean's. Against a 6-hourly atmosphere that is
**20** atmosphere steps per ocean step at O5 and **4** at O1 — both integers, so
O1 needs no code change. At `n_coupled_steps: 4` a sample spans 20 days at O5 and
4 days at O1; raising `n_coupled_steps` to 20 at O1 restores the 20-day horizon
and the same 81 atmosphere timepoints per sample.

The ocean statistics shipped here were computed on the 5-day stream. Measured
1-day/5-day standard-deviation ratios: 1.000–1.005 for `temperature_*`, `sst`,
`ssh` and ice area; **1.115** for `latentHeatFlux` and **1.130** for
`velocityMeridional_18`. Means agree to four significant figures. A production
1-day run should recompute its own with `compute_hist_stats.py`.

---

The ocean is forced from the MPAS streams but under **EAM variable names**,
because atmosphere→ocean coupling is resolved by intersecting the ocean's
input-only names with the atmosphere's output names. MPAS-native names give an
empty intersection, which used to train happily as a silently one-way coupled
model. `_validate_atmosphere_to_ocean_coupling` now **raises** on an empty
intersection when the ocean declares next-step forcings, and **warns** on a
partial match (a next-step forcing may legitimately come from the ocean's own
forcing window, and this code also runs when loading a trained checkpoint).

The mapping is config-only:

| ocean input | from MPAS | transform |
|---|---|---|
| `TAUX`, `TAUY` | `windStress{Zonal,Meridional}` | `rename` + `multiply_scalar: -1` |
| `FSNS` | `shortWaveHeatFlux` | `rename` |
| `FLDS` | `longWaveHeatFluxDown` | `rename` |
| `FLUS`, `LHFLX`, `SHFLX` | `longWaveHeatFluxUp`, `latentHeatFlux`, `sensibleHeatFlux` | `rename` + `multiply_scalar: -1` |
| `frozen_precipitation_rate` | `snowFlux` | `rename` |
| `surface_precipitation_rate` | `rainFlux + snowFlux` | `combine` |
| `sst` | `sst` | `add_scalar: 273.15` (MPAS is °C, stats are K) |

The sign flips are measured, not assumed: on open ice-free ocean the flipped
MPAS fields match EAM to 0.3–4.6% of each field's standard deviation. Without
the wind-stress flip, `TAUX` disagrees by 2.06 sigma.

`FSNS` replaces the `FSDS`/`FSUS` pair because MPAS carries only net shortwave,
so the atmosphere predicts `FSNS` (53 outputs, not 54). To revert, put `FSDS`
and `FSUS` back in `out_names`, loss weights and `force_positive_names`, and
split the ocean's shortwave input.

**`mask_and_scale: true` is required on every MPAS stream.** Those files flag
land with `_FillValue = 1e20` rather than NaN. Without it, land loads as a
literal 1e20 in the targets while output masking writes NaN over the same
points; the loss only zeroes points where the *target* is NaN, so training dies
with `Loss is NaN-valued`.

`icebergHeatFlux` is excluded — identically zero across the run, so its stats
scale is 0 and normalizing gives 0/0.

### LANDFRAC on the ocean axis

`LANDFRAC` and `sea_surface_fraction` are EAM fields absent from the MPAS
streams, but the coupled ocean needs them: a cell's sea ice fraction is
`ocean_sea_ice_fraction * (1 - LANDFRAC)`, and `mask_2d` is binary so it cannot
substitute (~20% of ocean cells are coastal with fractional land). Merge members
must share `sample_start_times`, so LANDFRAC is materialised on the 5-day axis:

    uv run python make_landfrac_ocn.py <output-dir>

126 year-files, 91 MB.

### Normalization

All three configs use statistics computed **from the historical run itself**,
restricted to the training windows (`train-only/`). This replaced piControl-derived
stats, which were a different climate with no CO2 trend.

    stats-2026-08-13/
        train-only/atmosphere/   <- config-train-atm and -cpl
        train-only/ocean/        <- config-train-ocn and -cpl
        atmosphere/, ocean/      <- full record; leaks into validation, see below
        _partials/               <- per-file partials; re-aggregate any window

Headlines (details in `NOTES-historical-stats.md`):

* All 1501 files of every stream, no subsampling; exact streaming algorithm
  (per-file count/mean/M2, Chan combination), so it is not an approximation.
* Computed on the field **as the loader delivers it** — transforms applied in
  loader order, so the sign flips, the `sst` Kelvin offset and
  `surface_precipitation_rate = rainFlux + snowFlux` are baked in. A sum of two
  fields cannot be reconstructed from the two fields' separate statistics.
* **Unweighted** over (time, lat, lon), matching `scripts/data_process/get_stats.py` and the
  existing files. When sanity-checking a value: unweighted global-mean `TS` is
  **279.5 K**, not the 287 K you get area-weighted. That is the convention.
* Coverage is a deliberate **superset** — 83 atmosphere and 127 ocean entries,
  versus 61 and 91 the configs reference. So reverting the `FSNS` split, or
  adding a channel like `TREFHT` or `sss`, needs no new statistics. Adding a
  *variable* does, and that re-reads the run (~23 min on three nodes).
* **Why `train-only/`**: it covers 1940–1990 and 2000–2040, exactly the training
  windows. The full-record set spans 1940–2065 and has therefore seen the
  validation window and the `5yr_test` period, which is leakage. Restricting
  is nearly free — of 503 numbers, all temperatures, winds, fluxes, salinities,
  velocities, precipitation, `PS`, `TS` and `LANDFRAC` move under 2%.

Three fields were dropped for a zero scale, each for a real reason: **`sol_tsi`
is `-1.0` in all 1501 files** (a sentinel — this EAM configuration never
diagnoses total solar irradiance), `icebergHeatFlux` is identically zero, and
`layerThicknessCoarsened_0` is exactly 20.0 m everywhere.

**Known wrinkle, `STW_0`.** Its full-field scale is 4.3× the piControl value
even in the train-only set, because the secular stratospheric-water trend spans
the training windows too; no choice of window fixes it. Its *residual* scale —
what the loss uses — is unchanged to 0.13%, so loss weighting is fine and only
the network input is ~4× more compressed. Worth watching if the stratosphere
misbehaves; not obviously wrong for a trending field.

To point at a different stats set without editing configs, override at launch.
The key prefix differs per config: `stepper.step.config.normalization` for atm
and ocn, but `stepper.<realm>.stepper.step.config.normalization` for cpl. The
ocean has only a `network` block; the atmosphere has `network` and `residual`,
and `residual` takes the *same* centering file with `scaling-residual.nc`:

    S=<stats-root>/train-only
    N=stepper.step.config.normalization

    --override \
      $N.network.global_means_path=$S/atmosphere/centering.nc \
      $N.network.global_stds_path=$S/atmosphere/scaling-full-field.nc \
      $N.residual.global_means_path=$S/atmosphere/centering.nc \
      $N.residual.global_stds_path=$S/atmosphere/scaling-residual.nc

## Short test runs

    uv run python make_smoke_config.py config-train-ocn.yaml \
        $PSCRATCH/smoke-ocn.yaml --experiment-dir $PSCRATCH/smoke-out

    uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 -m fme.ace.train $PSCRATCH/smoke-ocn.yaml
    # coupled uses a different entry point:
    uv run torchrun --nproc_per_node 4 -m fme.coupled.train $PSCRATCH/smoke-cpl.yaml

Defaults to 6 years of data, 2 epochs, batch size 4, no checkpointing, no
wandb. `--years`, `--epochs`, `--batch-size` adjust it; **`--batch-size` must
divide your rank count**, and the default 4 will fail on 8 ranks.

`--full-data` keeps the production globs and windows and shrinks only the epoch
count and inference block — use it to rehearse a production launch, since
dataset construction over ~1500 files per stream is the expensive and
historically fragile part.

Do not shrink by hand with `--override`: dotlist overrides cannot index into a
list, so they cannot reach the `inference` blocks or `concat`/`merge` members.

**Check the real exit code, not the log tail.** A `time_buffer` teardown emits
`Bad file descriptor` and `AssertionError: can only test a child process` on a
*successful* run; conversely a trailing `echo` can mask a rank failure. Look
for `REAL_EXIT=0` and `DONE ---- rank 0`.

## Library changes this branch depends on

These configs need `fme/` changes that are **committed on this branch but not
yet merged to `main`**, so a checkout of `main` cannot run them. The branch is
17 commits ahead of `main` and 3 behind.

| commit | change | why |
|---|---|---|
| `91b069b44` | `mask_and_scale`, `add_scalar`, `combine`, plus seven validation rules and generated metadata for combine targets | raw MPAS files flag land with `_FillValue = 1e20`; `sst` is degC while stats are K; MPAS has `rainFlux`+`snowFlux` but no total precipitation |
| `0a511e86f` | `get_raw_paths` stdlib-glob fast path; `_get_raw_times` serial and memoized | fsspec's glob is ~250× slower here; the old fork pool deadlocked ranks and a thread pool corrupted the heap |
| `83d034b34` | `logging.basicConfig(force=True)` | a stray root-logger call before configuration otherwise silences INFO for the whole run |
| `02caa33e5` | raise when no atmosphere output feeds the ocean | catches the MPAS/EAM naming mistake, which otherwise trains as silently one-way coupled |
| `9c264dfae` | restore the bare `frozen_precipitation_rate` alias | both the atm and ocn configs rename into it; `#1161` dropped it |
| *(this work)* | `use_reentrant=False` at the four checkpoint call sites, with regression tests | `checkpointing >= 1` silently dropped encoder gradients |

`3d26128ec` (`DataWriterConfig.prediction_names`) is also on the branch but no
config here uses it; it belongs to a separate PR.

The upstreamable library work is a clean, reviewable delta — 12 files,
+1227/−51, all with tests — and cutting it as a PR off `main` is the main
outstanding task.

---

## Two settings that are modeling decisions in disguise

Both live in `config-train-cpl.yaml` and look like optimizer plumbing. They are
not; know what they mean before changing (or keeping) them.

* **`use_gradient_accumulation: true` severs the atmosphere↔ocean gradient.**
  In the coupled path this flag makes `accumulate_loss` call `backward()` per
  realm-step immediately, and the stepper then *detaches* the atmosphere
  outputs before they are stacked into the ocean's forcings
  (`fme/coupled/stepper.py:1288`) and detaches both realms' carry-over states
  between outer coupled steps (`:1338`, `:1351`). As shipped, each model
  trains on its own loss with the coupling treated as constant forcing — no
  gradient ever crosses realms (the atmosphere additionally runs non-optimized
  steps under `no_grad` via `optimize_last_step_only: true`). This is likely
  the right memory/stability tradeoff, but it is a scientific choice, not an
  implementation detail. Setting it `false` restores one joint graph until
  `step_weights()` — at a large memory cost that was part of the original
  77 GB peak.
* **The coupled ocean's `EnsembleLoss` with `n_ensemble: 2` degenerates.**
  `Samudra.forward` takes no noise input, so both ensemble members are
  identical: the energy-score term is identically zero and CRPS collapses to
  MAE at twice the ocean forward cost. Either give the ocean a stochastic
  step or set its loss to MAE with `n_ensemble: 1` and save the compute.

## Gotchas

These all cost real debugging time; the symptoms are misleading.

* **Misleading DDP parameter-mismatch errors mean a straggling rank.**
  `DDP expects same model across all ranks, but Rank 1 has 70 params, while
  rank 0 has inconsistent 0 params` does *not* indicate a model mismatch. A
  rank stuck in dataset setup leaves its peers in DDP's allgather until the
  30-minute NCCL watchdog fires, and the aborted collective returns garbage.
  Run `py-spy dump --pid <pid>` on every rank — the odd one out is the cause.
  The watchdog output also names the straggler: the rank with the lower
  `Last enqueued NCCL work`.
* **An empty `out.log` with a run that is training normally** means a
  `logging.info` ran during `dacite` parsing, before `configure_logging`. The
  root-logger convenience functions implicitly call `basicConfig()`, so the
  later one is a no-op. If you add diagnostics to any `__post_init__`, use a
  module logger, never `logging.info`.
* **Inference start indices need room for the rollout.** `max_start_index +
  window_length` must not exceed the dataset length.
* **The inference aggregator defaults to a metric at step 20**, so a run with
  fewer than 21 forward steps dies with `MetricNotSupportedError`. Use ≥21
  steps or set `aggregator.log_step_means: []`.
* **Keep generated configs on a shared filesystem, never `/tmp`.** `/tmp` is
  node-local, so a config written there and launched with `srun` works only
  when the job lands on the writing node — it fails *intermittently*, and
  `torchrun` buries the `FileNotFoundError` ~80 lines above a `ChildFailedError`
  that reports only `exitcode: 1`. Write to `$PSCRATCH`. (`run-train.sh` does.)
* **Do not `git stash` while a run is starting.** Config parsing is strict, so
  if the tree briefly loses the `combine`/`mask_and_scale` fields, a launching
  run fails with `UnionMatchError: can not match type "dict" to any type of
  "train_loader.dataset"` — pointing at the dataset rather than the missing
  dataclass field.

`AGENTS.md` in this directory records what has actually been run, when, and at
what scale, along with the history of how these configs reached their current
state.
