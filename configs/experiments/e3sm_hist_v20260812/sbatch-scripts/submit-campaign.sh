#
# There is no dependency graph: the page's redesign makes every run an
# independent from-scratch training, so this just walks ../runs/MANIFEST.TSV in
# priority order and submits. Slurm decides what runs when.
#
# Why priority order matters. The run list adds up to 129 nodes and the
# reservation is 96, so a third of it cannot start at once. Submitting in
# priority order means the queue drains in the order the science needs:
#
#   P1  14 nodes  the four bolded baselines at B16 S01 (E01 E02 E05 E11)
#   P2  42 nodes  the single-seed science ablations -- the only measurement of
#                 their factor that exists at all
#   P3  28 nodes  seeds S02/S03 of the bolded four
#   P4  45 nodes  the B08/B32 batch sweeps -- an optimizer question, not a
#                 science question, and the right thing to lose to a queue
#
# P1+P2+P3 = 84 nodes and fits with 12 to spare; P4 lands as capacity frees.
#
# During the hackathon window, export the reservation or every job sits in the
# regular queue while the 96 reserved nodes idle:
#
#     RESERVATION=_CAP_aigs_hist ./submit-campaign.sh
#
# Keep it right to the end of the window (Sat 2026-09-05 15:00). A segment whose
# walltime runs past the reservation end still starts in it and is killed when
# the reservation ends -- inside a reservation `--time` is unconstrained and may
# exceed both the QOS maximum and the reservation itself
# (docs.nersc.gov/jobs/reservations). What that kill does not do is give the
# 300 s USR1 warning, which is keyed to `--time`: the job instead takes Slurm's
# plain SIGTERM with KillWait=30, which should reach preempt_handler and leave
# room for an 11 s checkpoint, but has never been run. Prefer a `--time` that
# fits.
#
# Segment length is a choice, not a limit. Dataset setup is 22.5 min per
# atmosphere start and 50.7 min per O1 ocean start, paid again on every requeue,
# so 12 h costs an 88-92 h run about 3.0 h of the 126 h window. Halve that with
#
#     RESERVATION=_CAP_aigs_hist FME_TIME=24:00:00 ./submit-campaign.sh
#
# on one line -- a bare `FME_TIME=...` on its own line is a non-exported shell
# assignment and never reaches run-train.sh.

# Email is on by default (run-train.sh sets it): $USER@nersc.gov on BEGIN, END,
# FAIL, REQUEUE and TIME_LIMIT_90. The whole campaign is order 250 messages, so
# either filter on the subject or submit with FME_MAIL_TYPE=FAIL,TIME_LIMIT_90
# to hear only about trouble.

# run-train.sh refuses a dirty worktree, so a campaign submission fails fast
# rather than half-queueing. Commit first. Runs that already have a checkpoint
# are continued from it, so re-running this script after a crash restarts what
# died and leaves the rest alone -- except for runs still in the queue, which
# it refuses, because two jobs writing one ckpt.tar corrupts the run.
